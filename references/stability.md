# Reference: Stability

Book anchors: §1.1 (constant-coefficient linear systems), §4.1 (Lyapunov stability definition
and direct method), §1.3 (nonlinear systems have multiple equilibria).

## Stability is the first requirement

(§1.1) For a control system, stability is demanded *before* anything else. A program that
gives the right answer *sometimes* but diverges, hangs, leaks, or corrupts state under
perturbation is **unstable** — and therefore useless, however clever.

### Lyapunov definition (§4.1), in plain terms

A motion is *stable* if: for any tolerated deviation ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that,
whenever the initial state starts within δ of the target, the trajectory stays within ε of the
target for all t ≥ t₀. *Asymptotically stable* if it also converges back to the target.

- Translate: **small perturbations must produce bounded deviation, not runaway.**
- "For all t" matters. A system that looks fine for 5 minutes then explodes is not stable.

## LLM behavior pattern: Stability before everything

> "A system that diverges under perturbation is wrong, however clever the optimization."

The LLM using this skill **must** verify stability before proposing any feature or
optimization. This is not a suggestion; it is the second cognitive law.

- Before generating performance optimizations, the LLM must reason: "Is the base system
  stable under perturbation? If not, I reject the optimization and fix stability first."
- Perturbations to consider: empty input, huge input, null, concurrent calls, network flake,
  dependency down, clock skew.

### Test for stability, not just correctness

- Probe with **perturbations**, not only golden paths: empty input, huge input, null,
  concurrent calls, network flake, one dependency down, clock skew.
- If deviation **grows without bound** under a small kick → unstable. Fix before features.
- Watch the **signatures of instability**:
  - unbounded growth → memory/CPU/disk creep, state explosion;
  - oscillation → retry storms, ping-pong state between two components;
  - limit cycle → two routines mutually undoing each other every tick.

## Local vs global stability (§1.3, §4.1)

- Linear systems are all-or-nothing: either every motion is stable or none is. So "is the
  system stable?" is a meaningful question *only* for linear systems.
- Nonlinear systems (and almost everything real, §1.4) can be stable in one region and
  unstable in another — each equilibrium has its own stability. "Works on my machine / small
  data" is **local stability only**. Probe the edges of the operating envelope.

## LLM behavior pattern: Reject unstable trajectories

> "If you observe a deviation that grows over iterations, you have lost stability. Stop. Do not paper over it with a 'slightly better' patch. Return to step 1 (Identify) and re-analyze the plant."

An LLM must not declare success when a trajectory is unstable. Growing deviation is a
hard-stop signal, not a minor concern.

## Worked example: retry storm → damped

**Before (unstable):**
```python
def fetch(url):
    for attempt in range(999):          # unbounded loop
        try:
            return requests.get(url, timeout=3)
        except requests.Timeout:
            continue                    # high gain, zero damping
```
No backoff, no circuit breaker, no jitter. Under load this oscillates: concurrent
retries amplify the load spike → each times out → more retries. Trajectory diverges.

**After (stable):**
```python
def fetch(url, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return requests.get(url, timeout=3)
        except requests.Timeout:
            delay = (2 ** attempt) + random.uniform(0, 0.1)  # exponential + jitter
            time.sleep(delay)           # damping
    raise CircuitBreakerOpen()          # open loop before saturation
```

- Bound on actuator (`max_retries`).
- Backoff = damping; jitter = break synchronization.
- Circuit breaker = open loop when service is unhealthy.

## Stabilizing a system

- Linear feedback (§5): `u = −Kx` pulls state back toward target. But simple feedback is not
  always enough (§5, §9.6): near actuator saturation or with bad phase margin, you need
  damping / lead correction, not just gain.
- Adding gain to "fix" a lagging or oscillating system often *destabilizes* it (§11): reduce
  loop gain or add damping instead.
- Keep stability margins explicit: how much worse can the input/get worse before it diverges?

## Stability is a structure property, not just a trajectory property

Book 2 anchor: §3.3 (稳态结构), §3.7 (超稳定系统). See `references/system-evolution.md` for
the full treatment.

A system sitting in a stable-state structure will return to it after small kicks. If the
behavior you're seeing is the system *sitting in an attractor*, no amount of input tweaking
will move it — the structure holds it there. To change the behavior, change the structure
(the interaction rules, the coupling, the feedback signs), not just the inputs.

Before trying to damp an oscillation, ask: is this an unstable trajectory (case 2 in
`references/system-evolution.md`), or is the system *in* a stable-state structure that I don't
want? The fixes differ — damping fixes the former, structural change fixes the latter.

## Feedback overcompensation produces oscillation (§5.6, Book 2)

Book 2 anchor: §5.6 (反馈过度). Negative feedback with too-aggressive correction oscillates
around the target instead of converging — the book calls this 目的性震颤 (intention tremor):
the hand reaches for the cup, overshoots left, overcorrects right, overshoots left, never
lands.

LLM equivalent: a test fails because of a missing timeout → LLM adds a 30-second timeout →
test now hangs on a different case → LLM removes all timeouts → original bug returns. Each
correction *reverses* the model instead of *reducing* its error.

> If corrections are reversing direction each iteration, you are overshooting. Reduce the gain
> (smaller, more targeted changes), do not flip the strategy. Reversal is not convergence — it
> is oscillation.

The fix is *gain reduction*: make smaller, more targeted changes. If the bug is "missing
timeout", the fix is "add a 2-second timeout with a clear error" (small change in the right
direction), not "add a 30-second timeout" (overshoot) and not "remove all timeouts"
(reversal).

## Ultra-stability: some instability is a repair mechanism (§3.7, Book 2)

Before patching an instability, ask whether it is a failure or a repair mechanism trying to
run. Cache evictions, GC pauses, circuit-breaker trips, autoscaler scale events — each looks
like instability on a graph, but is the system *returning to its setpoint*. Patching over
these converts a self-healing system into a brittle one. See `references/system-evolution.md`
for the full decision rule.
