# Reference: Closed-Loop Workflow & Analysis-before-Synthesis

Book anchors: §1.5 (analysis vs synthesis), §3.7 (feedback), §4 (control-system analysis).

## Why closed loop

An open-loop program — "write it once, hope it works" — has no path to recover from error. A
closed-loop program *acts → observes → corrects*, and therefore converges (§3.7: feedback
raises both accuracy and speed of response).

Operational rules:
- After every non-trivial change, **observe the actual state** before declaring success:
  run it, read output, check tests. Do not assume `u` produced the intended `x`.
- Prefer mechanisms that **measure** outcomes over mechanisms that **assert** they happened.
- If you cannot observe a quantity, you cannot control it (§1.5): a controlled quantity is
  steered only through a control quantity you are free to change.

## Analysis before synthesis (§1.5, §4)

> Analysis is understanding the motion of a given system; synthesis is changing that motion to
> meet a need. Analysis is the foundation; synthesis is the goal — and the higher stage.

- **Never skip analysis.** Before fixing or refactoring, characterize current behavior:
  reproduce, measure, locate the fault. You cannot steer what you have not measured.
- Then synthesize the *minimal* control action that moves state to the target.
- A change whose effect you cannot predict from analysis is an open-loop guess. Make the
  prediction explicit, then verify it.

## The loop, made concrete

| Step | Control term | What you actually do |
|------|--------------|----------------------|
| Identify | define `x`, `u`, sensors, bounds | Write down what must be correct and what lever you'll pull |
| Analyze | measure current trajectory | Reproduce the bug / profile the baseline |
| Stabilize | drive poles to stable region | Stop the divergence/leak/oscillation |
| Synthesize | choose control law `u = f(ε)` | Make the smallest change that moves `x` to target |
| Observe | read sensors | Run tests, read logs, check metrics |
| Correct | update `u` from error `ε = x* − x` | Iterate until `‖ε‖` is bounded and small |
| Compensate | feedforward + clamp | Pre-handle measurable disturbances; bound the actuator |
| Optimize | secondary criteria | Only now tune speed/cost/elegance |

## How to know the loop converged

- Deviation `ε` is **bounded** for the largest perturbation you can throw at it (stability, §4.1).
- Corrections get **smaller**, not larger, over iterations (no limit cycle, no retry storm).
- The setpoint is reached within the stated bounds (memory, time, rate limit).

## Worked example: analysis before synthesis — cache stampede

**Symptom:** under sudden traffic spike, database CPU spikes to 100%, API returns 503.

**Open-loop (skip analysis):**
```python
@app.get("/data/{id}")
def get_data(id):
    data = cache.get(id) or db.query(f"SELECT * FROM t WHERE id={id}")
    return data
```
Naive fix (synthesis without analysis): "just add a cache"

**Closed-loop (analysis first):**
```
Analyze:
  x = db CPU utilization; target < 70%
  u = cache TTL + eviction policy
  Model: thundering-herd on cache miss → spike proportional to missing-key rate
  Validity: model holds for any cache with TTL; breaks for in-process unbounded cache
```

**Stabilize first:**
```python
@app.get("/data/{id}")
def get_data(id):
    data = cache.get(id)
    if data is None:
        with lock:                    # serialize misses per key
            data = cache.get(id) or db.query(...)
            cache.set(id, data, ttl=60)
    return data
```
- Lock prevents thundering herd (damps the oscillation).
- TTL bounds memory.

**Then optimize:**
- Only after CPU is bounded <70%, consider increasing TTL or adding tiered caching.

Key point: adding a cache *without* the lock in the first patch would have shifted but not
eliminated the oscillation. Analysis → stabilize → then synthesize = closed loop.

## Why closed loop wins: feedback amplifies a weak controller (Book 2 §1.7–§1.8)

Book 2 anchor: §1.7–§1.8. See `references/possibility-space.md` for the full treatment.

The shallow reason closed loop beats open loop is "you can correct your mistakes". The deeper
reason, from Book 2, is that **negative feedback accumulates control ability**:

- Per-step control ability is bounded: M → m₁ (ratio M/m₁).
- Next step takes m₁ as input: m₁ → m₂ (ratio m₁/m₂).
- After n steps: total ability = (M/m₁) · (m₁/m₂) · … · (mₙ₋₁/m) = M/m.

A controller with small per-step ability can reach a target no single shot could reach, as
long as each step reduces the target gap. This is the deep justification for iterating with
small changes rather than trying to win in one shot — see the worked example in
`references/possibility-space.md`.

The book's plain-language framing (§1.8): "做起来看" — *do it and see*. When you cannot
predict the full trajectory in advance, start with limited control, observe, and let feedback
compound.

## Convergence speed vs. plant dynamics (Book 2 §5.5)

Book 2 anchor: §5.5. See `references/black-box-epistemology.md` for the full treatment.

Feedback rate must exceed the rate at which the plant changes, or the loop oscillates instead
of converging. Richardson's 1922 weather forecast took 6 weeks to compute for 6 hours ahead —
slower than the weather changed, so the prediction was always stale.

LLM equivalent: a flaky test that can only be reproduced by running the full suite (10 minutes
per cycle), but the failure depends on a state that mutates every few seconds. Each iteration's
observation is stale before you can act on it. The fix is to **tighten the loop** (unit test,
faster reproduction) before refining the model.

> If feedback speed is slower than plant dynamics, you will oscillate. Tighten the loop before
> refining the model.
