# Reference: State, Control, Observability & Bounds

Book anchor: §1.5 (controlled vs control quantities; constraints on both).

## Two kinds of variables

In every system you touch, separate:

- **Controlled variables x** — the things that must be correct: output values, internal
  state, invariants, latencies, error rates. You cannot set them directly; you can only
  *influence* them through the equations of motion.
- **Control variables u** — the levers you actually manipulate: function arguments, config
  values, the code you write, the inputs you feed. Only on u do you have freedom to act.

## LLM behavior pattern: Name x before u

> "Name the controlled variable x before proposing any change. Unnamed targets are unregulated."

An LLM using this skill **must** name the controlled variable and the control variable before
any proposal. This is not optional framing—it is the first cognitive law. If you cannot name
x, you cannot verify success; you are operating open-loop.

- "Make it work" is not a control problem; "reduce error rate below 1%" is.
- Before generating a patch, the LLM must internally resolve: what is x, what is u, and how
  will I measure x after u moves?

## LLM behavior pattern: Demand observability before acting

> "A failure mode you cannot observe will drift until it bites. Add the sensor first."

If the LLM identifies a plausible failure mode that is invisible to existing tests/logs, it
must **propose instrumentation before proposing the fix**. Acting without observability is
guessing; guessing is not control theory.

- If observability is impossible in the current environment, state that explicitly as a risk.
- Prefer mechanisms that *measure* outcomes over mechanisms that *assert* they happened.

## Bounds are physical, not optional (§1.5)

Linear regulation theory silently assumes variables are unbounded. Reality is not:

- Control quantities are bounded: thrust limits, voltage/power limits, **API rate limits**,
  **context-window size**, **stack depth**.
- Controlled quantities are bounded: integer ranges, buffer sizes, **memory**, **deadlines**.

Near a bound, linear intuition fails (saturation, overflow, OOM, token cutoff). Design for the
bound, not the asymptote. The book notes that ignoring limits makes "transition time
independent of step size" — which is simply false in practice. Same trap: assuming a function
behaves the same at n=10 and n=10^7.

## Observability vs controllability (§5.5)

- A state you can measure → you can close a loop on it (observable).
- A quantity you can change → you can steer it (controllable).
- Some states are neither easily measured nor directly changed — they must be *estimated*
  from observables. When debugging "impossible" faults, suspect a state that is observable
  only indirectly. Build the estimator (instrumentation) before concluding the bug is
  untraceable.
